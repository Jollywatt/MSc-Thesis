\chapter{Connections on Fibre Bundles}
\label{cha:connections}

We have seen that it is more natural to describe physical fields in the language of fibre bundles rather than simply as maps into a fixed codomain.
However, with a field $f ∈ \secs(ℱ)$ now formulated as a section of a fibre bundle, it no longer makes sense to directly compare values $f|_x$ at different points $x ∈ ℳ$, since each value exists in its own fibre.
But the ability to compare across fibres is desirable, particularly because a notion of derivative requires comparing values across `infinitesimally neighbouring' fibres.
To accomplish this, the additional structure of a \emph{connection} on the fibre bundle is required; this then defines the \emph{covariant derivative} of a section.

A trivial example of a connection is the one associated with (the tangent bundle of) Euclidean space.
In this case, tangent vectors at a base point may be \emph{parallel transported} (i.e., translated irrotationally) to any other base point in a well-defined, path-independent way.\sidenote{
	Any tangent vectors $𝒖_p ∈ \TT \RR^n ≅ \RR^n ⊕ \RR^n$ are compared by translating them to the origin (or discarding the base point) $𝒖_p ≡ (p, 𝒖) ↦ 𝒖 ∈ \RR^n$.
}
This defines an isomorphism between every tangent space and tangent space at the origin, which is a connection on $\TT \RR^n$.

We may try to define connections on general fibre bundles in this way, by choosing an isomorphism from every fibre to a single `reference' fibre.
This is the same as choosing a trivialisation $ℱ → ℳ × F$, which identifies every fibre with $F$ (equivalent to prescribing global coordinates on the bundle).

However, defining a connection by a trivialisation like this is a needlessly strict requirement, and is of course impossible to do globally on non-trivial bundles.
For instance, the tangent bundle of the sphere $\TT \Sphere^2$ is non-trivial, so it is impossible to give a globally smooth identification of tangent spaces.\sidenote{
	To see this, consider a point on the globe.
	Given a trivialisation of $\TT \Sphere^2$, the northward vector is extended to a vector field on the sphere.
	The hairy ball theorem implies the field vanishes at some point, at which the trivialisation fails.
}
However, it is always possible to define a connection \emph{locally} on the sphere, since local trivialisations always exist.
In other words, tangent vectors on the sphere can be parallel transported over sufficiently short paths, since locally the sphere looks like the Euclidean plane.

This generalises to all smooth manifolds: To define a connection, it is only necessary to specify how values are parallel-transported in an infinitesimal manner.




\section{Connections on General Fibre Bundles}


The most general kind of smooth bundle $ℱ$ is one where the fibres are each diffeomorphic to a manifold $F$ and have no further assumed structure.
A point $p ∈ ℱ$ in the bundle belongs to the fibre $F_{π(p)}$ rooted at the base point $π(p) ∈ ℳ$.
If the point $p$ is moved within its fibre, the base point remains fixed and the motion is said to be ``vertical''.
The tangent space $\TT_p F_{π(p)}$ of the fibre (in isolation from the bulk) consists of those displacement vectors which define vertical motion.
\begin{definition}
	The \textdef{vertical bundle} of a smooth fibre bundle $\fibrebundle F ℱ ℳ$ is a smooth $(\dim F)$-dimensional tangent subbundle $\VV ℱ ⊆ \TT ℱ$ defined by
	\begin{math}
		\VV_p ℱ = \TT_p F_p
	\end{math}
	for each point $p ∈ ℱ$.
\end{definition}
In other words, the tangent bundles of all the fibres taken together form the vertical bundle.


\begin{marginfigure}
	\centering
	\includefigure{ehresmann-connection}
	\caption{
		Illustration of an Ehresmann connection.
	}
	\label{fig:ehresmann-connection}
\end{marginfigure}
On the other hand, a \emph{connection} specifies how the value $p ∈ ℱ$ changes when the base point $π(p) ∈ ℳ$ moves, if $p$ is to be considered to move ``horizontally'', i.e., if $p$ is to undergo parallel transport.
\begin{definition}
	A \textdef{horizontal bundle} or \textdef{(Ehresmann) connection} $H$ on a smooth fibre bundle $\fibrebundle F ℱ ℳ$ is a smooth $(\dim ℳ)$-dimensional tangent subbundle $H ⊆ \TT ℱ$ which is complementary to the vertical bundle $V ⊆ \TT ℱ$, in the sense that
	\begin{math}
		\TT_p ℱ = \VV_p ℱ ⊕ H_p
	\end{math}
	for each point $p ∈ ℱ$.
\end{definition}
Note that while the tangent and vertical bundles $\TT ℱ$ and $\VV ℱ$ are canonical constructions, the choice of a horizontal bundle $H$ is not canonical: there may be many distinct horizontal bundles.



The requirement that $H$ be complimentary to $\VV ℱ$ implies $H_p ∩ \VV_p ℱ = \set{\symbf 0}$ at each $p ∈ ℱ$.
This means the restriction of $\dd π : \TT_pℱ \biject \TT_{π(p)}ℳ$ to $H_p ⊆ \TT_pℱ$ is an isomorphism.\sidenote{
	Using the fact that $\ker \dd π = \VV ℱ$, implying $\ker \dd π|_{H_p} = {
	\symbf 0}$.
}
It therefore has an inverse,
\begin{align}
	\label{eqn:lift-of-base-tangent-vectors}
	\dd π|_{H_p}^{-1} : \TT_{π(p)}ℳ \biject H_p
,\end{align}
which acts to ``lift'' tangent vectors from the base into the horizontal subbundle at $p$.
This proves to be a useful construction:
\begin{definition}
	\label{def:connection-map}
	Let $\fibrebundle[π] F ℱ ℳ$ be a fibre bundle with an Ehresmann connection $H ⊆ \TT ℱ$.
	The \textdef{horizontal lift} to the point $p ∈ ℱ$ is the linear map
	\begin{align}
	% 	Γ(p) &: \TT_{π(p)} ℳ → H_p
	% \\	Γ(p) &≔ -\dd π|_{H_p}^{-1}
		Γ(p) ≔ -\dd π|_{H_p}^{-1}
		: \TT_{π(p)} ℳ → H_p
	.\end{align}
	Also define the horizontal lift of a section $f ∈ ℱ$ at $x ∈ ℳ$ by
	\begin{align}
	% 	Γ : \secs(ℱ) &→ \forms[1](ℳ, H)
		Γ(f)|_x &≔ -\dd π|_{H_{f(x)}}^{-1}
	.\end{align}
\end{definition}
\begin{marginfigure}
	\centering
	\includefigure{connection-map}
	\caption{
		The tangent vector $𝒖$ at $x$ is lifted to the horizontal bulk vector $Γ_𝒖(f)$ at the point $f(x)$.
	}
	\label{fig:connection-map}
\end{marginfigure}
The horizontal lift of a section $f$ is a horizontal-valued $1$-form $Γ(f) ∈ \forms[1](ℳ, H)$, whose action on tangent vectors $𝒖$ we may write as $Γ_𝒖(f) ≔ Γ(f)(𝒖)$.
This device is designed so that tangent vectors $𝒖$ are `lifted' to horizontal bulk vectors $-Γ_𝒖(f)$ located on the section $f$ (see \cref{fig:connection-map}).
`Lifted' means $-Γ_𝒖(f)$ projects onto $𝒖$, so that we have $-\dd π (Γ_𝒖(f)) = 𝒖$.
The minus sign is present to later align with the convention that a plus sign is present in the covariant derivative of a vector section.\sidenote{
	E.g., ``$∇_μ X^a = ∂_μ X^a + Γ_μ{}^a{}_b X^b$''.
} 




\subsection{Parallel transport}

With a connection defined on a bundle, a value in the bulk may be moved between fibres so that the motion is always horizontal with respect to the connection.
This is called \textdef{parallel transportation} of the value along a path.

More precisely, a path $γ : [0, 1] → ℳ$ representing the motion of a value $p_0 ∈ ℱ$ from $γ(0) = π(p_0)$ can be \textdef{lifted} to a horizontal path $p_0 : [0, 1] → ℱ$ in the bulk.
This path is `above' $γ$ in the sense that $π(p_γ(λ)) = γ(λ)$, and `horizontal' in the sense that $\dd p_γ(λ) ∈ H_{p_γ(λ)}$ (see \cref{fig:lifted-path}).
In other words, $p_γ$ is a one-dimensional integral manifold of the connection $H$ restricted to the `wall' $π^{-1}(γ) ⊂ ℱ$.

\begin{marginfigure}
	\centering
	\includefigure{lifted-path}
	\caption{
		The point $p_0$ and its parallel transport $p_λ$ along a path $γ$.
	}
	\label{fig:lifted-path}
\end{marginfigure}

It is useful to describe this path--lifting process as an operator, which associates maps between fibres to each path in $ℳ$.
\begin{definition}
	\label{def:transport-operator}
	If $γ : [0, 1] → ℳ$ is a path, then the \textdef{transport operator} $\trans_γ : F_{γ(0)} → F_{γ(1)}$ is defined by
	\begin{math}
		\trans_γ p = p_γ(1)
	\end{math}
	for any point $p ∈ F_{γ(0)}$ where $p_γ : [0, 1] → ℱ$ is the lifted path satisfying
	\begin{align}
		\label{eqn:transport-operator-path-conds}
		π(p_γ(λ)) = γ(λ)
		\qqtext{and}
		\dd p_γ(λ) ∈ H_{p_γ(λ)}
	\end{align}
	for all $λ ∈ [0, 1]$.
\end{definition}
The transport operator is invariant under path reparametrisation, since any path $γ'(λ) = γ(f(λ))$ where $f : [0, 1] → [0, 1]$ is smooth also satisfies \cref{eqn:transport-operator-path-conds} if $γ$ does.
Furthermore, the transport operator respects path concatenation $γ_2 * γ_1$ and inversion,
\begin{align}
	\trans_{γ^{-1}} &= \trans_γ{}^{-1}
,&	\trans_{γ_2*γ_1} &= \trans_{γ_2} \circ \trans_{γ_1}
.\end{align}
This makes the transport operator a homomorphism from the groupoid of directed paths\sidenote{where the partially-defined group operation is path concatenation} (modulo reparametrisation) into the groupoid of fibre isomorphisms.



Parallel transport along a path involves integrating the connection, and the horizontal lift is the `derivative' of the transport operator, in a way made precise in the following lemma.
\begin{lemma}
	\label{lem:trans-ode}
	The transport operator along a path $γ$ satisfies the ordinary differential equation
	\begin{align}
		\label{eqn:trans-ode}
		\dv{λ} \trans_{γ(λ ← 0)} = -Γ_{\vb{\dot γ}(λ)} \circ \!\trans_{γ(λ ← 0)}
	,\end{align}
	where $γ(λ ← 0)$ denotes the sub-path of $γ$ from $γ(0)$ to $γ(λ)$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	If $p ∈ F_{γ(0)}$ then we have
	\begin{math}
		\trans_{γ(λ ← 0)} p = p_γ(λ)
	\end{math}
	where $p_γ$ is the lift of $γ$ through $p$, satisfying the conditions in \cref{def:transport-operator}.
	Differentiating with respect to $λ$,
	\begin{align}
		\label{eqn:trans-ode-working.1}
		\dv{λ} \trans_{γ(λ ← 0)} p = \dd p_γ(λ) ∈ H_{p_γ(λ)}
	,\end{align}
	which is the horizontal by \cref{eqn:transport-operator-path-conds}.
	Additionally, from $π \circ p_γ = γ$ we have $\dd π \circ \dd p_γ = \dd γ$.
	Thus, we see that $\dd p_γ(λ)$ is horizontal lift of $\dd γ(λ)$ to the point $p_γ(λ)$,
	\begin{align}
		\label{eqn:trans-ode-working.2}
		\dd p_γ(λ)
		= \dd π|_{H_{p_γ(λ)}}^{-1}(\dd γ(λ))
		= -Γ_{\vb{\dot γ}(λ)}(p_γ(λ))
	.\end{align}
	Finally, since
	\begin{math}
		p_γ(λ) = \trans_{γ(λ ← 0)} p
	\end{math},
	combining \cref{eqn:trans-ode-working.1,eqn:trans-ode-working.2} we have the result.
\end{proof}

\todo{Show how $Γ$ is a $\liealg{gl}(\manif E)$-valued $1$-form}

For a linear bundle (introduced in \cref{sec:vector-bundles}) the composition in \cref{eqn:trans-ode} is just matrix multiplication, and the resulting linear differential equation can be solved explicitly.

Evaluating \cref{lem:trans-ode} at $λ = 0$ yields the following useful result.
\begin{corollary}
	\label{lem:dtrans-is-hlift}
	Let $γ : [0, 1] → ℳ$ be a path and let $p ∈ ℱ_{γ(0)}$.
	\begin{align}
		\dv{λ} \trans_{γ(λ ← 0)} p \, \bigg|_{λ = 0} = -Γ_{\vb{\dot γ}(0)}(p)
	\end{align}
\end{corollary}

\subsection{Covariant differentiation}

We have seen that a choice of connection $H ⊂ \TT ℱ$ determines which tangent vectors in the bulk of a bundle are horizontal.
This in turn defines the coordinate-independent \textdef{covaraint derivative} as the rate of change of a section with respect to the connection's horizontal.

To decompose vectors into horizontal and vertical components according to $H$, we employ the \textdef{projection} and \textdef{rejection} maps
\begin{align}
	\label{eqn:proj-rej}
	\op{proj}_{H_p} : \TT_p ℱ → H_p
	\qqtext{and}
	\op{rej}_{H_p} : \TT_p ℱ → \VV_p ℱ
\end{align}
defined by $\op{proj}_{H_p} 𝒖 + \op{rej}_{H_p} 𝒖 = 𝒖 ∈ \TT_p ℱ$ and idempotence.


% We expect a submanifold $f$ of $ℱ$ (e.g., a curve or section) to have vanishing covariant derivative if the tangent space is horizontal (i.e., $\dd f$ everywhere lies in $H$).
% In other words, $f$ is covariantly constant if it is an integral manifold of the connection $H ⊆ \TT ℱ$.
% The covariant derivative then measures the failure of $f$ to be covariantly constant; i.e., the rate of change in $f$ relative to the connection's horizontal.

\begin{definition}
	\label{def:covariant-derivative-on-fibre-bundle}
	% The \textdef{covariant derivative} $\df ∇f : \TT_x ℳ → \VV_{f(x)} ℱ$ of a section $f ∈ \secs(ℱ)$ is defined by
	The \textdef{covariant derivative} $\df ∇f ∈ \forms[1](ℳ, \VV ℱ) $ of a section $f ∈ \secs(ℱ)$ is defined by
	\begin{align}
		% ∇f &: \TT_p ℳ → \VV_{f(p)} ℱ
		\label{eqn:covder}
		\df ∇f &= \op{rej}_H{} ∘ \dd f
	.\end{align}
\end{definition}
\Cref{eqn:covder} is a vertical-valued $1$-form, i.e., a linear map
\begin{math}
	\df ∇f|_x : \TT_x ℳ → \VV_{f(x)} ℱ
\end{math}
defined at each $x ∈ ℳ$.
Acting on a vector $𝒖 ∈ \TT_x ℳ$, this reads
\begin{align}
	∇_𝒖f ≔ \df ∇f(𝒖) = \op{rej}_{H_{f(x)}} \dd f(𝒖) ∈ \VV_{f(x)} ℱ
.\end{align}
This can be interpreted intuitively as follows.
The true gradient vector $\dd f(𝒖) ∈ \TT_{f(x)}ℱ$ of the section $f$ lies outside the fibre's tangent space $\VV_{f(x)}ℱ ⊆ \TT_{f(x)}ℱ$.
However, we do not want to measure horizontal motion --- just the \emph{effective} vertical change of $f(x)$ within the fibre induced by moving $x$ in the direction of $𝒖$.
Thus, the covariant derivative $∇_𝒖f ∈ \VV_{f(x)}ℱ$ is the vertical projection of $\dd f(𝒖)$ obtained by discarding its horizontal component, where `horizontal' is of course specified by the connection  (see \cref{fig:covariant-derivative}).


\begin{marginfigure}
	\includefigure{covariant-derivative}
	\caption{
		Covariant derivative of $f$ at $x ∈ ℳ$ along $𝒖 ∈ \TT_x ℳ$.
		The vector $-Γ_f(𝒖) = \dd π|_{H_{f(x)}}^{-1}(𝒖)$ indicates horizontal motion under the connection $H$, and $∇_𝒖f$ is the derivative relative to this horizontal.
	}
	\label{fig:covariant-derivative}
\end{marginfigure}

\begin{lemma}
	\label{lem:covariant-derivative-rewritten}
	The covariant derivative as in \cref{def:covariant-derivative-on-fibre-bundle} is equivalent to
	\begin{align}
		∇_𝒖 f = \dd f(𝒖) + Γ_𝒖(f) 
	,\end{align}
	where $\dd f$ is the push-forward of $f ∈ \secs(ℱ)$ and $Γ$ is the horizontal lift as in \cref{def:connection-map}.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	By the defining property of the projection and rejection \eqref{eqn:proj-rej},
	\begin{align}
		\dd f = \op{rej}_H{} ∘ \dd f + \op{proj}_H{} ∘ \dd f
	\end{align}
	since $\dd f : \TT ℳ → \TT ℱ$ is linear.
	Therefore, rewriting \cref{def:covariant-derivative-on-fibre-bundle},
	\begin{align}
		\df ∇f = \op{rej}_H{} ∘ \dd f
			= \dd f - \op{proj}_H{} ∘ \dd f
	.\end{align}
	Using \cref{eqn:lift-of-base-tangent-vectors}, the projection operator at $p ∈ ℱ$ can be written as
	\begin{align}
		\op{proj}_{H_p} = \dd π|_{H_p}^{-1} ∘ \dd π
	.\end{align}
	Finally, because $f$ is a section, $π ∘ f = \op{id}$ and so
	\begin{math}
		\dd π ∘ \dd f = \op{id}
	\end{math}
	by the chain rule (\cref{lem:differential-chain-rule}).
	Thus, acting on a base vector $𝒖 ∈ \TT_x ℳ$,
	\begin{align}
		∇_𝒖f
			&= \dd f(𝒖) - \dd π|_{H_{f(x)}}^{-1} ∘ \dd π ∘ \dd f (𝒖)
		\\	&= \dd f(𝒖) - \dd π|_{H_{f(x)}}^{-1} (𝒖)
	,\end{align}
	which by \cref{def:connection-map} gives the result.
\end{proof}









\subsubsection{Coordinate representation}

At this point, we may introduce component forms of the above devices for a general fibre bundle.
Let $\set{x^μ}$ be local coordinates on $ℳ$ and $\set{x^a}$ local coordinates of the fibres.
Let capital Latin indices $\set{x^A} = \set{x^μ, x^a}$ run over all coordinates so that $p ∈ ℱ$ has coordinates $(p^A) = (x^μ, x^a)$.
Vertical motion fixes the base coordinates, but the fibre coordinates $x^a$ are \emph{not} required to be constant under horizontal motion.

% The covariant derivative in \cref{lem:covariant-derivative-rewritten} acting on a section $f : ℳ → ℱ$ in the direction $𝒖 ∈ \TT_x ℳ$ has the full form
% \begin{align}
% 	∇_𝒖f = \dd f(𝒖) + Γ_f(𝒖)
% .\end{align}
% The connection map $Γ_f : \TTℳ → H ⊆ \TT ℱ$ is linear, so it is a $\TT ℱ$-valued $1$-form which we may write as a bitensor (i.e., matrix--valued) section $Γ_f : ℳ → \TT^*ℳ ⊗ \TT ℱ$.
% Without reference to $f$, we have $Γ : ℱ → \TT^*ℳ ⊗ \TT ℱ$ with $Γ_f(x) ≡ Γ(f(x))$.
% % The horizontal projection $\dd π|_{H_{f(x)}}^{-1} : \TT_xℳ → H_{f(x)} ⊆ \TT ℱ$ is a linear operator at each point in $ℱ$, so we may write it as a $\TT ℱ$-valued $1$-form.
Denote the associated coordinate basis of $\TT ℱ$ by $(\∂_A) = (\∂_μ, \∂_a)$.
Recall that $Γ(f) ∈ \forms[1](ℳ, H)$ is a $1$-form, and hence is linear in its tangent vector argument $𝒖 ∈ \secs(\TT ℳ)$.
Thus, we define the components
\begin{align}
	\label{eqn:covariant-derivative-coords.1}
	Γ_μ ≔ Γ_{\∂_μ}
\end{align}
so that
\begin{math}
	Γ_𝒖(f) = u^μ Γ_μ(f)
.\end{math}
Since $Γ_𝒖(f)|_x ∈ H_{f(x)}$ is a horizontal vector, we may also define the $2$-component form $Γ_μ{}^A$ by
\begin{align}
	Γ_μ(f) = Γ_μ{}^A(f) \, \∂_A
.\end{align}
Note that horizontal vectors have both fibre \emph{and} base components,
\begin{align}
	Γ_μ{}^A \, \∂_A = Γ_μ{}^ν \, \∂_ν + Γ_μ{}^a \, \∂_a
.\end{align}
Indeed, the same applies to the push-forward $\dd f$,
\begin{align}
	\dd f = \dd f^μ \, \∂_μ + \dd f^a \, \∂_a
\end{align}
since $\dd f$ is not vertical (refer back to \cref{fig:covariant-derivative}) --- this is the problem the covariant derivative addresses.
However, since $∇_μ f ∈ \VV ℱ$ as a whole \emph{is} vertical, the base components $Γ_μ{}^ν$ and $\dd f^ν$ must cancel.

This is verified by noting that
\begin{align}
	\label{eqn:covariant-derivative-coords.2}
	\dd π (\dd f (𝒖)) = 𝒖
	\qqtext{and}
	\dd π(-Γ_{f(x)}(𝒖)) ≡ \dd π (\dd π|_{H_{f(x)}}^{-1}(𝒖)) = 𝒖
\end{align}
are equal.
In effect, $\dd π$ projects onto components of the base,
\begin{math}
	\dd π(X^A \∂_A) = X^ν \∂_ν
,\end{math}
and so \cref{eqn:covariant-derivative-coords.2} implies $\dd f^ν(𝒖) = -u^μΓ_μ{}^ν$.
Therefore, in components, the covariant derivative of a section is
\begin{align}
	\label{eqn:covder-comps-general-bundle}
	∇_μ f^a = ∂_μ f^a + Γ_μ{}^a(f)
,\end{align}
with base components of $\dd f(𝒖)$ and $Γ_𝒖(f)$ suppressed.\sidenote{
	In practice, one usually works with a (local) trivialisation in which $f : ℳ → F$ is given as a field.
	Then, $\dd f = \dd f^a \, \∂_a$ has no base components anyway, so we take $Γ_μ(f) = Γ_μ{}^a(f) \, \∂_a$.
}
Note that $f$ need not be a vector section of a linear bundle --- \cref{eqn:covder-comps-general-bundle} is general to smooth fibre bundles.


\subsection{Structured connections}
\label{sec:vector-bundles}

So far, we have treated connections in the setting of a general fibre bundle, in which fibres have the minimal structure of a smooth manifold.
We now consider connections and their associated covariant derivatives on \emph{vector} bundles $\fibrebundle V 𝒱 ℳ$, with more or less additional structure.

\subsubsection{On vector bundles}

In general, the transport operator over a path is an invertible map between the start and end fibres.
For a vector bundle, we require this to be a \emph{linear} map.
By \cref{lem:trans-ode}, this means the horizontal lift is also linear in its fibre argument,
\begin{math}
	\df Γ(λ^i X_i) = λ^i \df Γ(X_i)
,\end{math}
so we may regard $Γ_𝒖$ as a matrix and $\df Γ$ as a matrix-valued $1$-form, acting on vectors $X ∈ 𝒱$ by matrix multiplication,
\begin{math}
	\df Γ X ≔ \df Γ(X)
.\end{math}

If $\set{\ve_a}$ is a basis for some vector bundle $\fibrebundle V 𝒱 ℳ$, then we may introduce the $3$-component \textdef{connection coefficients},
\begin{align}
	Γ_μ{}^a{}_b ≔ Γ_μ{}^a \ve_b
.\end{align}
We may write expressions in both basis-free and component forms; 
\begin{align}
	Γ_𝒖 X = u^μ \, Γ_μ{}^a{}_b \, X^b \, \ve_a
.\end{align}

Linearity also allows the covariant derivative to be expressed as the limit of a difference, similar to the usual analytical definition of the derivative of a real function.
\begin{lemma}
	\label{lem:trans-and-covariant-der}
	If $γ : [0, 1] → ℳ$ is a path and $X ∈ \secs_γ(𝒱)$ is a smooth vector section defined on $γ$, then
	\begin{align}
		∇_{\vb{\dot γ}(0)} X|_{γ(0)}
		&= \lim_{ε → 0} \frac{X|_{γ(ε)} - \trans_{γ(ε ← 0)}X|_{γ(0)}}{ε}
	\\	&= \dv{λ}\eval{\qty(X|_{γ(λ)} - \trans_{γ(λ ← 0)}X|_{γ(0)})}_{λ=0}
	.\end{align}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Using \cref{lem:dtrans-is-hlift}, the right-hand side is equal to
	\begin{align}
		\dd X(\vb{\dot γ}(0)) + Γ_{\vb{\dot γ}(0)}X
	,\end{align}
	which by \cref{lem:covariant-derivative-rewritten} is equal to $∇_{\vb{\dot γ}(0)} X|_{γ(0)}$.
\end{proof}



\subsubsection{Metric compatibility}

A linear connection on a vector bundle $\fibrebundle V 𝒱 ℳ$ is called \textdef{metric compatible} if for any vectors $X, Y ∈ 𝒱$,
\begin{align}
	\ip{\trans X, \trans Y} = \ip{X, Y}
\end{align}
where the transport operators are over some common path. 
\begin{lemma}
	A metric compatible connection satisfies
	\begin{align}
		\ip{\df Γ X, Y} = -\ip{X, \df Γ Y}
		\qqtext{or}
		Γ_{μab} = -Γ_{μba}
	\end{align}
	where $Γ_{μab} = η_{ac}Γ_μ{}^c{}_b$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Consider transport along a path $γ(λ ← 0)$, and abbreviate $T_λ ≔ \trans_{γ(λ ← 0)}$.
	Since $\ip{T_λ X, T_λ Y} = \ip{X, Y}$ is constant with respect to $λ$, its $λ$-derivative vanishes.
	But we also have
	\begin{align}
		0 = \dv{λ} \ip{T_λ X, T_λ Y} \bigg|_{λ = 0}
		% &= \dv{λ} \ip{X, Y} \bigg|_{λ = 0} = 0
		&= \ip{\dv{λ} T_λ X \, \big|_{λ = 0}, Y} + \ip{X, \dv{λ} T_λ Y \, \big|_{λ = 0}}
	\\	&= -\ip{Γ_{\vb{\dot γ}(0)}X, Y} - \ip{X, Γ_{\vb{\dot γ}(0)}Y}
	.\end{align}
	Since $γ$ is arbitrary, we have
	\begin{math}
		\ip{Γ_𝒖 X, Y} + \ip{X, Γ_𝒖 Y} = 0
	\end{math}
	for all $𝒖 ∈ \TT ℳ$.

	Writing this in component form,
	\begin{align}
		η_{ab} \, Γ_μ{}^a{}_c \, X^c \, Y^b
		= -η_{ab} \, X^a \, Γ_μ{}^b{}_c \, Y^c
	\end{align}
	which implies
	\begin{math}
		η_{ab} \, Γ_μ{}^a{}_c
		= -η_{ab} \, Γ_μ{}^b{}_c
	\end{math}
	since $X$ and $Y$ are arbitrary.
\end{proof}



\subsubsection{Algebra-preserving connections}

Vector bundles may be further equipped with an associative product, forming an algebra bundle.
We require the product $⊛ : V_x × V_x → V_x$ to vary smoothy with $x ∈ ℳ$, so that $X ⊛ Y ∈ \secs(𝒱)$ is a smooth section whenever $X$ and $Y$ are.
Requiring the transport operator to respect this product means enforcing
\begin{align}
	\label{eqn:trans-respect-prod}
	(\trans X) ⊛ (\trans Y) = \trans (X ⊛ Y)
,\end{align}
which places further constraints on the connection.
\begin{lemma}
	\label{lem:covder-prod}
	Let $⊛$ be a bilinear associative product on a vector bundle $𝒱$ which is respected by parallel transport as in \cref{eqn:trans-respect-prod}.
	Then,
	\begin{align}
		\label{eqn:covder-prod}
		\df ∇ (\etc{X_\i}⊛k) = \df\dd (\etc{X_\i}⊛k) + \sum_{i=1}^k \etcmid{X_\i}{\df Γ X_i}⊛k
	\end{align}
	for $X_i ∈ \secs(𝒱)$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Let $T_λ ≔ \trans_{γ(λ ← 0)}$ for some path $γ$.
	Using \cref{lem:trans-and-covariant-der}, we have
	\begin{samepage}
	\begin{fullwidth}
	\begin{align}
		∇_{\vb{\dot γ}(0)} (\etc{X_\i}⊛k)
		= \df\dd(\etc{X_\i}⊛k)(\vb{\dot γ}(0))
		- \dv{λ} \trans_{γ(λ ← 0)}(\etc{X_\i}⊛k) \bigg|_{λ = 0}
	.\end{align}
	\end{fullwidth}
	\end{samepage}
	Since $⊛$ is respected by parallel transport, and by bilinearity and associativity, the rightmost term is
	\begin{align}
		-\dv{λ} \etc{T_λ X_i}⊛k \, \bigg|_{λ=0} = -\sum_{i=1}^k \etcmid{X_\i}{\dv{λ} T_λ X_i \big|_{λ=0}}⊛k
	,\end{align}
	which by \cref{lem:dtrans-is-hlift} gives the result, after removing reverence to the arbitrary vector $\vb{\dot γ}(0)$.
\end{proof}

\todo{Show $\df ∇$ is derivation.}
A consequence of \cref{lem:covder-prod} is that a linear connection on a vector bundle $𝒱$ induces a unique $⊛$-respecting connection on the algebra bundle generated by $⊛$.
In particular, such a connection obeys the product rule:
\begin{align}
	\df ∇(X ⊛ Y)
	&= \df\dd X ⊛ Y + X ⊛ \df\dd Y + \df Γ X ⊛ Y + X ⊛ \df Γ Y
\\	&= \df ∇ X ⊛ Y + X ⊛ \df ∇ Y
\end{align}
For example, for the tensor bundle $\TA{𝒱}$, we obtain the product rule written in component form,
\begin{align}
	\label{eqn:covder-tensor-prod}
	∇_μ X^a Y^b = ∂_μ(X^a Y^b) + Γ_μ{}^a{}_c X^c Y^b + X^a Γ_μ{}^b{}_c Y^c
,\end{align}
and if the connection is also compatible with a metric used to raise and lower indices, we derive the familiar formula for covariant differentiation of general type-$(p, q)$ tensors,{}
% \begin{samepage}
\begin{fullwidth}
\begin{align}
	\label{eqn:covder-general-tensor}
	∇_μT^{a_1\cdots a_p}{}_{b_1\cdots b_q}
	= ∂_μT^{a_1\cdots a_p}{}_{b_1\cdots b_q}
	+ \sum_{i = 1}^p Γ_μ{}^{a_i}{}_c T^{a_1\cdots c\cdots a_p}{}_{b_1\cdots b_q}
	- \sum_{j = 1}^q Γ_μ{}^c{}_{b_j} T^{a_1\cdots a_p}{}_{b_1\cdots c\cdots b_q}
.\end{align}
\end{fullwidth}
% \end{samepage}
% Note that \cref{eqn:covder-general-tensor} is written only in terms of the connection coefficients $Γ_μ{}^a{}_b$ on $𝒱$.


\subsubsection{On geometric algebra bundles}

The covariant derivative assumes an elegant form when expressed as a bivector operator in the geometric algebra framework.
A geometric algebra $\GA(V, η)$ may be defined on a manifold by taking $V$ to be the vector space of \emph{sections} $\secs(𝒱)$.
We write $\GA(𝒱, η)$ as shorthand for $\GA(\secs(𝒱), η)$ to indicate this construction.




Consider the covariant derivative of a vector $𝑿 ∈ \GA[1](𝒱, η)$,
\begin{align}
	∇_μ 𝑿 = (∂_μ X^a + Γ_μ{}^a{}_b X^b) \ve_a
.\end{align}
Rewrite the non-derivative term as
\begin{align}
	Γ_μ{}^a{}_b \, \ve_a X^b
	&= Γ_{μab} \, \ve^a (\ve^b \fatdot 𝑿)
\\	&= \frac12 Γ_{μab} \, (\ve^a (\ve^b \fatdot 𝑿) - (\ve^a \fatdot 𝑿) \ve^b )
\end{align}
using the fact that $Γ_{μab} = -Γ_{μba}$ for a metric compatible connection, and that $\ve^a \fatdot 𝑿$ is a scalar commuting with $\ve^b$.
Then, since for vectors the inner product is $𝑿 \fatdot 𝒀 = \frac12(𝑿𝒀 + 𝒀𝑿)$, this is b
\begin{align}
	\frac14 Γ_{μab} \, (\ve^a \ve^b 𝑿 + \ve^a 𝑿 \ve^b - \ve^b 𝑿 \ve^a - 𝑿 \ve^b \ve^a)
	&= \frac12 Γ_{μab} \, (\ve^a \ve^b 𝑿 - 𝑿 \ve^a \ve^b)
.\end{align}
In the right-hand side, the scalar parts from the products between $\ve^a$ and $\ve^b$ cancel, leaving a commutator product of the bivector $\ve^a ∧ \ve^b$ with $𝑿$,
\begin{align}
	Γ_{μab} \, (\ve^a ∧ \ve^b) × 𝑿 = ω_μ × 𝑿
,\end{align}
where we define the \textdef{connection bivectors} in the basis $\set{\ve_a}$ by
\begin{align}
	\label{eqn:connection-bivectors}
	ω_μ ≔ Γ_{μab} \, \ve^a ∧ \ve^b
.\end{align}
Thus, we may write the covariant derivative of $𝑿$ as
\begin{align}
	\label{eqn:covder-connection-bivectors}
	∇_μ 𝑿 = ∂_μ 𝑿 + ω_μ × 𝑿
.\end{align}

The connection bivectors are especially useful for writing covariant expressions in the geometric algebra, because the form of \cref{eqn:covder-connection-bivectors} is in fact general to all multivectors --- in sharp contrast to, e.g., \cref{eqn:covder-tensor-prod,eqn:covder-general-tensor} in terms of connection coefficients.
For sake of basis-independent notation, we may define the \textdef{connection bivector $1$-form} $\df ω$ by
\begin{align}
	\df ω(𝒖) ≡ ω_𝒖 ≔ u^a ω_a
\end{align}
expressed in any basis.

\begin{lemma}
	\label{lem:covder-multivector}
	The covariant derivative of any multivector $A ∈ \GA(𝒱, η)$ is
	\begin{align}
		\df ∇ A = \df\dd A + \df ω × A
	.\end{align}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	The covariant derivative is a derivation if the connection respects the geometric product.
	Therefore, the covariant derivative of a product of $k$-many vectors is
	\begin{align}
		\df ∇(\etc{𝒖_\i}{}k)
		% &= \sum_{i=1}^k \etcmid{𝒖_\i}{(\df ∇ 𝒖_i)}{}k
		&= \sum_{i=1}^k \etcmid{𝒖_\i}{(\df\dd 𝒖_i + \df ω × 𝒖_i)}{}k
	% \\	&= \df\dd(\etc{𝒖_\i}{}k) + \sum_{i=1}^k \etcmid{𝒖_\i}{(\df ω × 𝒖_i)}{}k
	\\	&= \df\dd(\etc{𝒖_\i}{}k) + \df ω × (\etc{𝒖_\i}{}k)
	,\end{align}
	using \cref{eqn:covder-connection-bivectors} and the fact that commutation by a bivector is a derivation (\cref{lem:commutator-derivation}).
	Since all multivectors are linear combinations of products of vectors, the general result follows.
\end{proof}


A rapid alternative derivation of \cref{lem:covder-multivector} starts from the observation that parallel transport along a path may be written as
\begin{align}
	\trans_γ A = R A \rev{R}
,\end{align}
since any transformation continuously connected to the identity which preserves the geometric product belongs to the rotor group, $\op{Spin}^+$ (see \cref{sec:rotors}).
Any such rotor is of the form $R = e^{σ/2}$ for a bivector $σ$, so we have
\begin{align}
	\dv{λ} \trans_{γ(λ ← 0)} A = \frac12 R (σ A - A σ) \rev{R}
\end{align}
where $σ = σ(λ)$ and hence $R$ are functions of the path parameter.
At $λ = 0$, the rotor is trivial, so by \cref{lem:dtrans-is-hlift} we find
\begin{align}
	\dv{λ} \trans_{γ(λ ← 0)} A \, \bigg|_{λ=0} = -Γ_{\vb{\dot γ}(0)}(A) = σ(0) × A
.\end{align}
Thus, the horizontal lift is given by commutation with a specified bivector.
Since this holds for arbitrary multivectors $A$, by \cref{lem:covariant-derivative-rewritten} we have the universally applicable formula for the covariant derivative of a multivector
\begin{align}
	∇_𝒖 A = ∂_𝒖 A + ω_𝒖 × A
\end{align}
where $ω_𝒖$ is the required bivector.





\section{Covariant Algebraic Derivatives}


The covariant derivative $∇_𝒖$ is analogous to the directional derivative $∂_𝒖$ of \cref{sec:algder}, but defined for sections on a manifold $F ∈ \secs(𝒜)$ instead of fields on a vector space $F : V → A$.
In identical vein to \cref{def:algder}, it is useful to define a `total' derivative operator $𝒟$ which is independent of a direction $𝒖 ∈ \TT ℳ$.
Like the algebraic derivative $\DD$ of \cref{sec:algder}, $𝒟$ is defined whenever an inclusion $ι : \TT^*ℳ → 𝒜$ is given (but usually left implicit) enabling tangent vectors to be multiplied by elements in the algebra.

\begin{definition}
	\label{def:covalgder}
	Let $\fibrebundle A 𝒜 ℳ$ be an algebra bundle with product $⊛$ and connection $\df ∇$, equipped with an inclusion $ι : \TT^*ℳ → 𝒜$.
	The \textdef{covariant algebraic derivative} of a section $F ∈ \secs(𝒜)$ is
	\begin{align}
		𝒟 F ≔ ι(\ve^a) ⊛ ∇_{\ve_a} F
	\end{align}
	(summation on $a$) where $\set{\ve_a} ⊂ \secs(\TT ℳ)$ and $\set{\ve^a} ⊂ \secs(\TT^* ℳ)$ are dual bases of tangent sections.
\end{definition}


\subsection{Covariant vector derivative}

The geometric algebra $\GA(V, η)$ may be defined on a manifold by taking $V$ to be the vector space of tangent sections $\secs(\TT ℳ)$.
Write $\GA(ℳ, η)$ as shorthand for $\GA(\secs(\TT ℳ), η)$ to indicate this construction.

On a geometric algebra bundle $\GA(ℳ, η)$, \cref{def:covalgder} is the \textdef{covariant vector derivative} $\VD$ and has similar properties to the vector derivative $\vd$ on $\GA(V, η)$.
Given a basis $\set{\ve^a}$ (of $\secs(\TT^* ℳ)$ and $\GA[1](ℳ, η)$ alike), the covariant vector derivative is the operator
\begin{align}
	\VD = \ve^a ∇_a
,\end{align}
sharing the algebraic properties of a grade-$1$ vector.\sidenote{Hence its bold symbol, like $\vd$.}
In particular, for a $k$-vector section $F ∈ \GA[k](ℳ, η)$, there is a decomposition into $(k ± 1)$-grade parts,
\begin{align}
	\VD F = \VD \lcontr F + \VD ∧ F
.\end{align}
