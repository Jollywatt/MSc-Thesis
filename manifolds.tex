\chapter{The Problem: Curvature}






Here we only give a pragmatic definition of a manifold as a space which locally looks like $\RR^n$ upon which one can do calculus.
(More rigour can be found in the first chapter of \cite{lee2012diffgeo}.)
\begin{definition}
	\label{def:manifold}
	A \textdef{manifold $\manif M$ of dimension $n$} is a nice\sidenote{
		Here, a `nice' topological space is:
		\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=1.3em]
		\item \emph{Hausdorff}, meaning each distinct pair of points have mutually disjoint neighbourhoods (so it is ``not too small''); and
		\item \emph{second-countable}, meaning there exists a countable base (so it is ``not too large'').
		\end{enumerate}
	} topological space which is locally Euclidean, meaning for every $x ‚àà \manif M$ there exist neighbourhoods $x ‚àà \manif U \subseteq \manif M$ and subsets $U \subseteq \RR^n$ with a homeomorphism (continuous bijection) $\manif U \biject U$ between them.

	A \textdef{smooth manifold} is a manifold with the stricter requirement that $\manif U \biject U$ be a diffeomorphism (differentiable bijection).
\end{definition}

The definitions that follow take place in the category of manifolds.
Furthermore, if the qualifier ``smooth'' is present, then the objects exist in the category of \emph{smooth manifolds} in which all maps are smooth (i.e., infinitely differentiable).
This means all maps between manifolds are \emph{assumed to be continuous}.

Essentially, \cref{def:manifold} is designed to guarantee that well-behaved local coordinates always exist.
\begin{definition}
	Let $\manif M$ be an $n$-dimensional manifold.
	A \textdef{(global) coordinate chart $\set{x^i} ‚â° \set{\etc{x^\i},n}$} of $‚Ñ≥$ is a set of scalar fields $x^i : \manif M ‚Üí \RR$ such that each point in $‚Ñ≥$ is specified uniquely by the coordinate values $(x^1, ..., x^n) ‚àà \RR^n$.
	A \textdef{local coordinate chart} about a point $x ‚àà \manif M$ is a coordinate chart of a neighbourhood of $x$.
\end{definition}
We will often call a point $x ‚àà \manif M$ by the same symbol as the local coordinates $x^i : \manif M ‚Üí \RR$ without the index --- but these objects are not interchangeable.



\chapter{The Answer: Fibre Bundles}
\label{cha:fibre-bundles}

\todo{Treating physical things as fields} would suggest that all values are directly comparable, making expressions like $f(x) + f(y) ‚àà A$ geometrically meaningful for different points $x,y ‚àà ‚Ñ≥$.
However, an important lesson from physical theories like general relativity is that it is very often beneficial to distinguish between codomains \emph{at each point in the domain}.

	\label{fig:ball}
\end{marginfigure}

This can be motivated with the simple example of a fluid flowing on a sphere:
The instantaneous fluid velocity at a point is a vector lying in the sphere's tangent plane at that point.
If the fluid flow is given as a field $f : \Sphere^2 ‚Üí \RR^2$, then any two velocity vectors exist in the ``same'' space, even when \emph{geometrically} they do not (\cref{fig:ball}).
This is more than a purely philosophical point: the fluid flow's representation as a field $f : \Sphere^2 ‚Üí \RR^2$ is dependent on the choice of basis, i.e., the way in which the single codomain $\RR^2$ is identified with each tangent plane on the sphere.
We would do better with a more geometrical representation of the vector field which is independent of any choice of basis, viewing the fluid velocities at different points as existing in different spaces.

This leads to the formulation of a tangent ``bundle'' $\TT \Sphere^2$, where all the tangent planes of $\Sphere^2$ are collected in a disjoint union forming a manifold.
The vector field on the sphere now becomes a ``section'' of $\TT \Sphere^2$, which is a map $f : \Sphere^2 ‚Üí \TT \Sphere^2$ satisfying some conditions.
The tangent bundle is a special case of a ``fibre bundle'', which is a manifold consisting of disjoint copies of a space (called the ``fibre'') taken at every point in a base manifold.


\begin{definition}
	\label{def:fibre-bundle}
	A \textdef{fibre bundle} $\fibrebundle[œÄ] F ‚Ñ± ‚Ñ≥$ consists of
	\begin{itemize}
		% \item a \textdef{fibre manifold} $A$;
		\item a \textdef{bulk manifold} $‚Ñ±$;
		\item a \textdef{base manifold} $‚Ñ≥$; and
		\item a surjection $œÄ : ‚Ñ± ‚Üí ‚Ñ≥$, the \textdef{projection}, such that
		\item the inverse image $F_x ‚âî œÄ^{-1}(x)$ of a base point $x ‚àà ‚Ñ≥$ is homeomorphic to the \textdef{fibre} $F$.
	\end{itemize}
\end{definition}


\begin{marginfigure}
	\includefigure[\columnwidth]{fibre-bundle}
	\caption{
		(a) A field $f : ‚Ñ≥ ‚Üí F$, where values at any point can be compared.
		(b) A fibre bundle $\fibrebundle F ‚Ñ± ‚Ñ≥$ with a section $f ‚àà \secs(‚Ñ±)$ whose individual fibres $F$ are labelled by base point in $‚Ñ≥$.
	}
\end{marginfigure}





Thus, the projection $œÄ : ùíú ‚Üí ‚Ñ≥$ in \cref{def:fibre-bundle} is required to be continuous; and in a \textdef{smooth fibre bundle}, the projection $œÄ$ is differentiable and $F$, $‚Ñ±$ and $‚Ñ≥$ are all smooth manifolds.
